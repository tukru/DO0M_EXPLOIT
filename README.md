HTML DOOM Exploit for BWAPP
Description

This Python script exploits a vulnerability in the bWAPP web application when the security level is set to medium. The script injects an HTML payload containing an iframe that targets a specific URL. The goal of this exploit is to demonstrate the vulnerability and the potential risks associated with it.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    requests library: To install, run pip install requests

Usage

    Ensure that the bWAPP web application is running and accessible.
    Modify the payload variable in the script with your desired iframe URL.
    Update the login credentials (data dictionary) and the target URL in the login() function if necessary.
    Run the script using the command python3 html_doom_exploit.py.

How it Works

The script follows these steps:

    Registers a signal handler to handle Ctrl-C and exit gracefully.
    Logs into the bWAPP web application using the provided credentials and security level.
    Injects the HTML payload containing an iframe into the web application.
    If the payload injection is successful, a confirmation message is displayed.

Functions

    def_handler(sig, frame): Handles the Ctrl-C signal and exits the script gracefully.
    login(): Logs into the bWAPP web application and returns a requests.Session object.
    def_exploit(session): Injects the HTML payload into the web application using the provided session.
